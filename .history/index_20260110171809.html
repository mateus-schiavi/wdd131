            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    My name is Mateus, but some of my friends call me Schiavi. I was born in Brazil and I live with my
                    family in Suzano. <br>
                    I am currently working as programming teacher at a programming school in São Paulo. The gospel of
                    Jesus
                    Christ are my world and I love sharing it with every person. <br>
                    I also serve as a missionary service at BYU Pathway Worldwide. I love to serve and learn new things
                    everyday.

                        Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest in the world.
                        It is located in the Eastern part of the continent and is bordered by almost every
                        South American country. Brazil is home to the Amazon Rainforest, which plays a vital
                        role in regulating the Earth's climate.
                        <br><br>
                        The country has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Indigenous peoples, African
                        traditions, and European settlers. Portuguese is the official language, and Brazil is
                        known worldwide for its music, festivals, cuisine, and passion for football (soccer).
                        <br><br>
                        Brazil also has great economic and natural diversity, with large urban centers such as
                        São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as vast rural and natural areas. Its people are
                        known for their hospitality, creativity, and strong sense of community.
